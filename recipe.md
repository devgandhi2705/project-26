INSTRUCTIONS:

1.Cut paneer into cubes. To a large bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch,
  3 tablespoons flour along with salt, pepper.

2.Add water to make a free flowing batter, it should neither be thick nor thin.
 I added little less than 1/2 cup water here. Meanwhile heat oil in a wok/kadai
  on medium heat to deep fry the paneer.

3.Dip each paneer cube into the batter. And then add them into the hot oil.

4.Fry until the paneer pieces get golden brown and crispy from both sides.
   Drain the fried paneer on paper towel.

5.Meanwhile, in a measuring jar or bowl, add soy sauce (I use regular and dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon each), rice vinegar, green chili sauce, tomato ketchup and sugar. Mix until all is well combined and set aside.

6.Also mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water until cornstarch dissolves completely and set aside.

7.Heat sesame oil and avocado oil in wok on high heat. Once oil is hot,
 add the ginger, garlic, celery and green chili. Saute for 1 minute.

8.Then add the quartered onion and peppers. Cook for 2 minutes. 
Veggies should remain crunchy and you should cook on high heat.
9.Add in the prepared sauce and mix and lower heat to medium.

10.Then add in the prepared cornstarch slurry. Mix well, 
sauce will begin to thicken. Add additional 3 to 4 tablespoons water.

11.Stir in the fried paneer cubes. Toss to combine the paneer with the sauce.

12.Turn off heat and garnish with green onions.

13.Serve Chilli Paneer with noodles or rice!

NOTES:

1.You may pan fry the paneer cubes as well. Heat few tablespoons of oil in a pan and pan fry paneer until golden-brown from both sides.

2.To make this recipe gluten-free, use rice flour in place of all purpose flour. Also use tamari (gluten-free soy sauce) in place of regular soy sauce.
